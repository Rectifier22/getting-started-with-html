<b>The Web - World Wide Web</b>
<br>Invented in the 1990’s and currently consists of approximately 30 Billion pages.
<b>HTML</b> is the common language of the web. While many types of files such as Plain Text, HTML, Images, Videos, and Music, HTML is the main type of document found on the web. The web is comprised of documents linked together via <b>Hyper Links</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</b>
  <br><br>
  <b><em>HTML</em></b> is made up of:
<br>•	Text Content
<br>•	Markup – What it looks like
<br>•	References to (e.g. images and videos)
<br>•	Links to other pages
</p>
<p>
  Markup is achieved with the use of HTML "Tags."
  <br>Tags are often comprised of a set of Opening < X > and Closing tags < / X>
  <br><br><b><em>NOTE:</b><b>Void</b> Tags do not have a Closing Tag.</em>
  <br><br><b>Element</b> - Everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
  <br><b>Attribute</b> - Property of the HTML element.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Inline / Block</b>
    <br><br>Examples of <b><u><em>Inline</em></u></b> Tags
    <br>< b > - <b>Bold</b> - makes the text bold
    <br>< em > - <b>Emphasis</b> - presents the text in an italicized form  
    <br>< span > - <b>Span</b> - ??? I will learn what this does later
    <br>< a href > - <b>Anchor Tag</b> -  Used for making links
    <br>< img > - <b>Image Tag</b> -  Used to include images. Consists of a source location (src=) and alternate text (alt=)
    <br>< br > - <b>Line Break</b> -  Used set contents on the next line
    <br><br>Examples of <b><u><em>Block</em></u></b> Tags
    <br>< p > - <b>Paragraph</b> - This tag is used to set the contents on a new line but also creates an invisible box around the text that can have additional parameters such as Vertical and Horizontal
    <br>< div > - <b>Div</b> - ??? I will learn what this does later
